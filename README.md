# Week-2-assignment-image-gallery-

This weeks assignment i found quiet complex and difficult to navigate. I managed to upload the images for my image gallery but couldnt figure out how to get it to full screen. Also, with my image gallery you have to press on one of the pictures for the "main-container-image" to pop up; unlike the example we were shown. My 'thumbnail-container' is also like a bunch of images at the top rather than the container which is smaller with images which is easier to click on and navigate through.
